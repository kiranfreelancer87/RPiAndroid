Done

kept an eye on the watch but nothing happened

now?notification center says no notifications still

i have enabled every setting except the one that reads the nofication outloud when it is received

Now all enabled?

In app notification is receiving but notification isn't being created see the selected test that is send by notification payload

I saw that text yes
Notification?

nothing//okay now try to minimize the app and check once

app minimized?

yes

the watch just flashed...

When got notification?

no notification but I just closed the app again. try one more time

ok
Done

nothing

tRY once more please
Done

unfortunately nothing on this end still

Yeah I see...Actually notification is coming but not showing

oh weird

can we check the permissions of the app to make sure it has permission to send the notification?
It doesn't required permission for notification...
Wait let me confirm with that if it really required permission

okay

have you got any?

no but I just exited the app
 lets try one more time

 sent

 still nothing. I checked the code while you ran it and saw it run

It's weired...Notification is working on Emulator but not on real device

what does the "resource failed to call close" mean?

That code already removed

ok.ayu


Let me check another method for creating notification

5 min

okay

Any notification?

Please check once if other app is giving notification or not

just closed app

checking

no notifications but lets try one more time
Done

no notifications

wait you just said to check if other app is giving notification

are there 2 apps? I only have one on the watch

No only 1 app for watch...I mean if you have any other application on watch and that is giving notification or not

And check once if your phone haas dnd activated...Is it sync with phone now?

okay checking

Settings > Security > Notification Access (Within the Notification access screen, make sure that Android Wear is checked.)

But I think it shouldn't be the issue because our app is standalone wear os app

dnd is not activated o the phone and I have it set so that every app can get through notifications

Okay can you please test once with any other application if you're able to get it or not...




yeah I have been getting email notifications on the phone the entire time

On wear os?no not on the waatch

I will try to set that up

ok please check and update

sent

Send 3 time

still no notifications

let me see if I can get an email notification to come through

ok

I have checked Android official site same way we're using for notification here as well

I am rebooting phone and watch to see if the notifications come through. I have gone through every step to turn them and while i am getting them on the phone they are not going to the watch

Email notification also?

yes. that is what I mainly trying to test
ok

got one on the watch!

ok

let me send now

GOT IT

LOL finally

FINALLY!!!!...So we're done with notification now we'll setup this with button click give me 15 min let me setup the code....


Pi is on? Pi is on


can you please connect to pi from your pc

yes. what is the best way to that?

From TeamViewercan I have multiple session at the same time? I am using teamviewer right now with you on the PC


oh sorry yeah...Need to disconnect...Let me connect there

okay

watch connected to wifi?

Please check it's IP
okay
watch IP:192.168.99.55
phone IP: 192.168.99.174
do you need pi?

no

push button

Try to push the button

okay. while you were doing that I got a notification but I didnt press a button

Yeah it was pending one because watch was offline

got it. that worked.

working now?

yep!

okay..I think app is getting killed by system if not is use for long time

Just open it once when you start to use

the RPi app or the json?

Watch app

okay. so if i started out just turning on the computer and watch, how would I make it work?


No no need to connect with computer....When you start using the  notification just open app and minimize in wear os only

okay. is the raspberry pi part of this equation anymore?

No...Just need to run program on RPi incase you restart it

Once it is runnning no need to do anything else

great. So can you please show me how I can start running this tomorrow when I bring it all to a new location?

Just copy RPi filder to another Pi

in terminal run one command "pip install firebase_admin"

then open that

got it. can I go test that real quick?

Yeah sure

So what I want to do is close out everything anfd I want to try running that command and pressing the button

Suppose you placed the RPi folder in Desktop/RPi

open ternimal:
cd Desktop
cd RPi
python3 RGB.py
but right now RPi folder is not on desktop?
It's already on Desktop...If you move to another Pi keep in same location so easy for you

I see. Okay. Luckily I will be using the same Pi at the location tomorrow.
So what I am going to do right now is close out Thonny and terminal and everything else on Pi
and then I am going to open terminal and follow those directions

Can you switch back to pi desktop to see if I do it all correctly and confir, it works?
okay
awesome thank you
